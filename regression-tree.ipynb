    "# Regression Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main model will be a regression forest. First, we'll design a generic regression tree model that can be applied to any player based on the Federer pilot tree. We'll then populate a forest with any number of these trees to obtain a distribution of predictions. Hyperparameter selection will be done through GridSearchCV. I'm chosing this approach instead of a classic Forest Regressor because, due to the volatile nature of our problem, it's hard to say whether any individual tree's prediction is better than another's. Thus, I'd like to visualize the whole range of predictions offered by my trees."
